Playing around with Amazon co-produced produce with .
Attempting to see which products are the most popular, and what its co-purchased products are.
This is a graphing excercise to see how to visualize the most "inflencial product".

##
For this challenge, I decided to use python and neo4j to visualize the relationship between produce.
The data set is from 
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/

##
The dataset is too large to graph with neo4j today, so I will be presenting a subset of the data.

##
This is what the data set looks like with 1000 produces.

##
Here it is with 25 products.

## 
To see the most influencial products, I parsed the first 100 data entries from the data set and graphed this as follows:

##
Top 5

Top 3
